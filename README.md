selfexplanatory :))

To run HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code in Google Chrome directly from VS Code with a shortcut, you can follow these steps:

Option 1: Using the "Live Server" Extension
Install the "Live Server" Extension:

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "Live Server" and click Install on the extension by Ritwick Dey.
Open Your Code:

Open your HTML file (or any web-related file) in VS Code.
Run Your Code:

Right-click on the HTML file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server". Alternatively, use the shortcut Alt+L then Alt+O to launch the server.
This will automatically open the page in your default browser (Chrome if it’s set as the default).
If you want to force Chrome to open, just make Chrome your default browser or manually copy the URL that Live Server generates and paste it in Chrome.
Auto-Refresh:

Live Server auto-refreshes the page every time you save the file, so you don’t need to manually refresh it in the browser.
Option 2: Use a Shortcut for External Tools (Custom Browser Launch)
You can set up a shortcut to open your HTML file in Chrome using a task or an external tool like a custom VS Code extension. Here's how you can do it:

Create a Task:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
Type "Tasks: Configure Task" and select it.
Choose "Create tasks.json from template" and select Others.
Add the following configuration to the tasks.json file:
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Open in Chrome",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "start chrome ${file}",
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}
This tells VS Code to open your file in Google Chrome.

Run the Task:

Press Ctrl+Shift+B to run the task, which will launch the file in Chrome.
